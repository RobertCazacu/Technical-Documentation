      <p>A coffee bean is a seed from the Coffea plant and the source for coffee. It is the pip inside the red or purple fruit. This fruit is often referred to as a coffee cherry, and like the cherry, it is a fruit with a pipe</p>
      <p> Even though the coffee beans are not technically beans, they are referred to as such because of their resemblance to true beans.</p>

      <p>The fruits most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together. A small percentage of cherries contain a single seed, instead of the usual two, called a "peaberry".</p>

      <p>As coffee is one of the world's most widely consumed beverages, coffee beans are a major cash crop and an important export product, accounting for over 50% of some developing nations' foreign exchange earnings.</p>
      <p>This has made coffee very important in culture and food around the world.[7] In 2017, 70% of total coffee production was exported, worth US$19.9 billion.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Methods">
      <header>Methods</header>
      <p>Two methods are primarily used to process coffee berries. The first, "wet" or "washed" process, has historically usually been carried out in Central America and areas of Africa.</p>
      <p> The flesh of the cherries is separated from the seeds and then the seeds are fermented â€“ soaked in water for about two days. This softens the mucilage, which is a sticky pulp residue that is still attached to the seeds. Then this mucilage is washed off with water.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whici are the primarly mothod to process?</li>
        <li>Why are fermented in watter for 2 days?</li>

      <p>The term "green coffee bean" refers to unroasted mature or immature coffee beans. These have been processed by wet or dry methods to remove the outer pulp and mucilage and have an intact wax layer on the outer surface. When immature, they are green. When mature, they have a brown to yellow or reddish color and typically weigh 300 to 330 mg per dried coffee bean.</p>
      <p>Nonvolatile and volatile compounds in green coffee beans, such as caffeine, deter many insects and animals from eating them. Further, both nonvolatile and volatile compounds contribute to the flavor of the coffee bean when it is roasted. Nonvolatile nitrogenous compounds (including alkaloids, trigonelline, proteins, and free amino acids) and carbohydrates are of major importance in producing the full aroma of roasted coffee and for its biological action.</p>
